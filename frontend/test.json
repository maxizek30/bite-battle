I got home in (5 minutes), and the first thing my husband and I see is a pile of grey mush. One cardinal rule in the kitchen is that when you fry something, it doesn't get SMOTHERED in a gravy, and if to go, the gravy is on the SIDE. Weirdest almond chicken I've ever seen.\nAlso, not sure why they batered an egg roll. It was so crispy it hurt your gums to bite it and the wrap itself was somehow kept some raw due to the thickness of the batter. The filling is bland on the inside, plus the noodles and fried rice were average at best. I cut open the egg roll to see if it was the egg roll but returned both meals. I won't be returning.\nPs. No matter what you do, a TBS of sauce will not cover the amount of protein they give. This is their version of 'Almond chicken. This is how it comes for all proteins and the sauce is always underneath.\n\nUpdate. Husband returned 10 min. later with the same food. Restaurant refused to do it over or even offer something different, refused to refund, and all that was said was \"that's the way it's been done for 30 years.\" Not sure how people are giving this place more than 2 stars, but the bad experience with their take out has made it so we DO NOT wish to have the sitdown experience. Husband ate because of blood sugar, but I ate a left over omelet. Waste of time and $.",

Every time I drive by their business looks busy so I was super excited to come in and try the food. Mexican food is my favorite!\nThe menu is big, a few pages in fact. And I am probably the most indecisive person known to any server. I definitely wanted to try something I have never had before but couldn't decide what sounded the best. Descriptions are fairly basic so that wasn't helping me decide either. My boyfriend and I decided to start with drinks. He got a margarita and I got a tequila sunset (not sunrise). I was excited because I don't know many places that can make them since they call for a blackberry liqueur in the recipes I am familiar with. The margarita was very sweet. Tasty but sweet. The sunset looked like a tequila orange juice and kinda tasted like it too. I didn't watch them make it, so I can't say exactly how it was assembled. When the waitress returned (very nice girl), I asked her for suggestions. She suggested the burrito. 😔Not what I was hoping to hear, but I love burritos so if the staff likes them I guess I will go for it. Both my boyfriend and I get wet burritos. Mine with the seasoned pork and his the carne asada. They are big and hot when they come out. My boyfriend immediately comments on the lack of rice and beans that the menu stated it came with, and I suggest they might be inside. They were. I feel like the flavor is really good on the meat but that it is a bit dry. I also like the bite size pieces that they are cut into. There is a good amount of pork stuffed into my burrito, but again it is a bit dry. My boyfriend is not happy with his. He doesn't like the flavor or that everything about his wet burritos is dry. I tend to agree. I tasted just a bite of the steak in his as well and it had almost no flavor. He agreed that mine was better seasoned. The highlight of the meal was my Grandeza Margarita. It was a better balance of sweet, sour and booze than the other cocktails we got.",
